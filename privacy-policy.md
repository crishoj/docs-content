# FormKit Privacy Policy

#### Last updated: October 24, 2022

FormKit is a set of related websites and software packages (“FormKit”, “Network”, or “Services”) for making a better web, owned and operated by FormKit, Inc. (“FormKit”, “us, “we”, or “our”), a Delaware Corporation headquartered in Virginia. FormKit respects your privacy and is committed to maintaining and using the information you share with us responsibly. We try to collect as little as possible. We collect customer (form makers', not users') information to improve your overall experience with us, charge you appropriately for usage, and clue us in on features you want. This privacy policy addresses the use and disclosure of information we collect from you.

**We do not and will not sell your personal information.**

## Personal Information We Collect

We collect the following categories of personal information:

1. **Contact information** — This category includes your name, email address, and other information primarily used to identify you, like a profile image, GitHub ID, and your Google ID (if you want to log in using Google).
2. **Transactional information** — This category includes information about items you purchased and your payment method, such as a payment card. Note that payment card transactions go through our vendor (Stripe), so we do not have the full card number.
3. **Interests and preferences** — This category includes information about what color mode you like to use and the searches within the Network (powered by Algolia) to help us build and improve FormKit.
4. **Network information** — This category — collected by our analytics provider “Fathom Analytics” — includes your IP address, browser type or similar system information (type of device), country, and the pages you view within the Network. Importantly, Fathom Analytics is “a GDPR, CCPA, ePrivacy, and PECR compliant analytics service” which cannot identify you as an individual.
5. **Project information** — This category includes your team name, project name, project URL, and which FormKit features you have used so we can charge you appropriately.

## How We Collect Personal Information

We collect personal information in the following ways:

### Directly from you —

1. If you ask a question or make a request, you will need to provide sufficient contact information for us to respond.
2. If you transact business with us, you must provide sufficient information to enable the transaction.
3. When creating an account, you must provide sufficient information to identify yourself.
4. When you create a project, you will need to provide sufficient information to set up the project and obtain a Project Key.

### Passive collection through your use of our services —

1. _Fathom Analytics_ is a third-party analytics provider. Fathom temporarily saves your IP Address and User Agent for 24 hours and then anonymizes it. Other data includes page views,
2. FormKit never sends form data or PII of any kind. FormKit Open Source, Pro Unlimited, and Enterprise have no telemetry of any kind. `@formkit/pro` sends minimal usage data — 1) the domain name, and 2) the names of the Pro features in use — to our central system.

## Why We Collect Personal Information

We collect personal information for the following purposes:

1. To respond to your questions and requests;
2. To process transactions with you and charge you appropriately;
3. To prevent fraud or theft in our system;
4. To offer products and services that we think will interest you;
5. To improve your overall experience with us; and
6. To protect our network, systems, and data, including personal information.

Why we can legally collect information from you. We collect information for three main reasons:

1. We collect Network and Contact Information to perform the [Terms of Service](/terms) and provide our services to you,
2. FormKit has a legitimate interest in understanding how customers and potential customers use its Network, so we collect Interests and Preferences and Transactional Information to do that, and
3. The consent of FormKit's users to our Privacy Policy and [Terms of Service](/terms) for which we collect Network and Contact Information.

## When We Share Personal Information

**We do not sell your personal information.**

We may disclose your personal information (all categories identified above) to vendors performing operational services on our behalf, processing or fulfilling orders and transactions, processing payments, providing analytic services, providing data storage, or providing similar services. For the purposes of California law, we have neither sold nor shared personal information in the last 12 months.

## How Long We Keep Personal Information

We keep any collected personal information for as long as necessary to satisfy your requests and comply with legal requirements.
